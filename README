** Build Environment for the vex cortex **

Files:

vex_hw.h : contains documentation on the vex hardware, settings, spi, etc.

Directories:

./lib : includes *{.c,.h} from the STD Peripheral Lib 3.2.0
./ld  : linker scripts from various sources.
./STM*: example project which uses an older Std. Peri. Lib and a
        different board.

Building:

You need a "arm-none-eabi" (or "armv7m-none-eabi" if you want to have fun)
toolchain (binutils + gcc + newlib). Other arm targets ("arm-elf-none")
may also work, but I haven't tested them.

Windows:
	codesourcery lite (calls make cs-make) 
	Ride 7's arm build tools ( Ride is gui used by IFI for devel)
	Manual build using cygwin should be possible.

Linux:
	I use gentoo's crossdev script with the library selection fixed to
		select newlib for *-none-* targets (may not always be
		correct, but works fine here).
	Otherwise, manual build.

Mac :
	Manual build.
